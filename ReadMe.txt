These are various school projects I have worked on. Most of them are from my Data Structures 
and Algorithms class,but there are a few from other courses. Most of these are header files, created and run on
main.cpp files our instructor created. I have included a project also. It a store program
based off instructions from my Professor. I will continue to update with more and I will
most likely create another repository for passion projects (Unreal and Unity).
